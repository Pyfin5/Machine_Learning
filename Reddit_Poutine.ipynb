            "don’t you have enough at home?<eos>i’m actually curious to know what kind of poutine is making you drive all the way to quebec…<eos>if i had the funds, i would go to quebec every two months for routine and bagels.<eos>farm boy sells st.alberts curds cheese if you want to try and make it at home!<eos>this post is so funny. good for you girl - get that poutine.<eos>you can try finding other options on dating apps, joining a club in your area is also a good way to meet people /s<eos>i would go on a regular basis from barrie to montreal to eat at st hubert, so it’s not that unusual.<eos>the pantry fine cheese shipps in fresh cheese curds every friday. they are stored @ room temperature throughout the weekend until they sell out. thats how you know its fresh. they can be stored @ room temperature for quite a few days when fresh.they squeek like quebec curds. you can make your own authentic poutine this way. be there on a fri or sat. on sunday they sell out. there might be a few early sunday. friday is absolute best. they taste more creamy and milky with full bounce.<eos>i think this is really adorable. i hope you find good poutine in the gta and then also keep up the tradition. you can go with friends sometimes too, so he doesn’t have to go 6 times.<eos>nom nom close thread<eos>have you considered starting a poutine community. i know at least two people that will join 100%.<eos>i mean if you like going there i dont see the problem. maybe if shes coming with you and wants to expand her horizons food wise though.but nomnomnom is considered one of the best. i like leslieville pumps.<eos>life is short! eat poutine and do your thing. new york fries is goated for me. consistent, widely available, delicious, cheap, and vegetarian.<eos>just buy their cheese curds and make it yourself at home lol<eos>i really like the poutine at obq burger on browns line off the 427 exit. im sure there are tons of options in downtown though<eos>this is sooo real<eos>you’re my spirit animal. i’m not as obsessed with poutine, but would travel for food or activity i like. why wouldn’t your boyfriend come with you? quebec is lovely.<eos>i can’t tell if this is a troll post or not, but i take poutine pretty seriously so i’ll throw in my advice: i honestly haven’t found many amazing ones in toronto that compare to the authenticity of quebec. however, as someone who grew up in a fairly francophone part of ontario, i know that great ones exist. i haven’t been up to my hometown in a long time so i don’t have recommendations, but the penetanguishene area is pretty french, and it’s only a couple hours drive.<eos>-large fry bag from costco (cavendish supercrisp, i think its called). do them in the air fryer- clubhouse chicken gravy, easy to make on the stove- st alberts curds are sold in many storesthere, now you have no excuse to cheat on your husband<eos>you can make your own... the recipe is so simplemy mom would gorge on poutine whenever she would visit from overseas, until i told her the ingredients and now she just makes her own all the timeonce you figure out how you like your gravy, the rest is just potato and cheese<eos>now i wanna take a road trip for poutine<eos>i understand. im going to toronto either in august or september because they have better patties, carribean food and chinese food then montreal.you should try ma poule mouille in montreal for their poutinemay i add  that many  people from quebec go to ontario (ottawa) to eat popeyes, cinnabon chipotle because we dont have that in quebec because of the bill 101<eos>lmao<eos>op, please share your poutine spot recommendations<eos>if you are being honest, that is absurd and your partner is correct.<eos>\"poutine\", is that what youre calling her now?<eos>lol op i rly dont have a resolution for you but honestly, this might just be the most real post ive seen on this app. i love poutine and id absolutely be doing the same thing if i could 😭 you go girl<eos>soooo… i’m looking to have a weekend away soon. any recommendations for vegetarian poutine in quebec?<eos>i dont blame you at all (i could really go for a smoked meat poutine from lesters rn) but you might like the poutine at rudy the toronto burger chain. its pretty traditional<eos>> partner is upset that i visit quebec every 2 months for poutine, need options in gta> i lovveeee poutine! i love it so much that i visit quebec every 2 months and stay there for a night and just eat poutine from different locations. my boyfriend says it might be a little unreasonable to go there just for poutine, so looking for poutine recommendations in gta. im a vegetarian if that makes any difference. thanks in advance > edit - lol - im 29f and my partner is 29m. i dont go there alone and lock myself to eat poutine. we always drive to quebec together. he just wants a cheap alternative. find him a long distance girlfriend in quebec and youll be getting your poutine road trip fix every two weeks instead of every two months.<eos>i love poutine but just go to harvey’s or costco to get my fix and then i’m good for a month. everyone says nom nom is the place to go but i found their fries a bit bland. perhaps i went on an off day but it’s otherwise a very solid choice.<eos>went to a mirabel for a track event, food wasn’t even part of the equation at the time - that food truck poutine blew the doors off anything i’ve had in ontario.<eos>im with you on loving poutine. nomnom nom (dundas & bathurst) and any lication of rudy in the city tends to be very good imo.<eos>a cheap alternative is letting me tag along to have me pitch in on gas 🤭🤭  i’m front ottawa and i too crave quebec poutine.<eos>can you supply me with a list of good places to go in montreal? i’d love to do this as well.<eos>this post made me happy to know someone loves poutine more than me. it’s one of the best things ever! haha<eos>if you ever go a last time, make sure the try the veggie poutine at chez claudette on 351 laurier street in the heart of le plateau.every time i go visit my family in qc, i always go.<eos>i’d love to go to quebec every 2 months. you can just take me instead 😆<eos>do you have any single older sisters or friends with a similar obsession for poutine?<eos>can the op please make a blog rating each place they have gone to in quebec, or even the gta. im so curious!<eos>this is why carney must build that high speed rail line, immediately<eos>costco food court<eos>“poutine”<eos>the poutine at sunnyside provisions on roncy is veg and pretty good!! def recommend.<eos>i have no experience with this place, but passed by it the other day: https://maps.app.goo.gl/tsntgudgmzt9i3sb8<eos>they sell poutine at st alberts cheese factory store/restaurant in st albert, ontario. i was there a few weeks ago but only got curds - they sell huge bags of curds for $40. i saw many quebec bikers here, so it must be good.   alternatively, morrisons restaurant in downtown kingston has excellent poutine.  but, id make my own fries and gravy.  i like turkey gravy and baked fries with the curds.<eos>just for poutine?? i mean if you like it that much you can probably order some supplies and make it at home lol. its just potatoes, cheese and sauce lmao. they sell the curds, you can bulk make some good quality gravy and store. only thing is fries, which can be bought frozen, or made at home.<eos>i totally get it!  im from quebec and really miss the poutine.  one of the reasons its so good is the squeaky cheese. as for finding an alternative here, its tough.  i think happy burger makes a decent poutine, but i dont know if they have a veg gravy option.<eos>i’ll go with you lol. people around me think i’m crazy for driving to montreal for poutine and then coming back.<eos>i highly respect your dedication. if you want something, go get it.<eos>this is fun and i love it for you. keep going to quebec! live what you love.<eos>someone here is gonna hate me but i gotta speak my truth. poutine hits the spot but it’s pretty basic food. i don’t get why people have such strong opinions on it. i’ve had montreal poutines, sure it’s great but it’s still gravy cheap fries and curds. not really exponentially better than ones i’ve had in ontario. 🤷‍♂️i don’t understand the fuss and find it amusing that we have food snobbery over a cheap bar dish.<eos>sounds like you just need to make the québec trip more worth it. like add fresh bagels, chocolate croissants, hangout at mount royal.<eos>paddingtons in the st lawerence market. their poutine is pretty delicious. squeaky cheese, perfect fries and gravy hits<eos>from toronto to montreal and every 2 months isn’t that bad.  on airline points or flight pass could even be a good ritual<eos>i am dumb. but doesnt poutine gravy have beef in it?<eos>dont they make great poutine in kingston?? bubbas i believe its called?<eos>ngl that’s a bit extreme and indulgent - it’s also no issue if you make enough money where the expenses incurred don’t impact you or your future. if you have the excess disposable income, then you do you!if you don’t (ie, no assets, no equity, perpetual debt, etc.), then you need to reevaluate that indulgence. personally, i’d learn to make the poutine at home and fine tune it to a science (still not cheap, but not incurring travel, lodging, miscellaneous costs along the journey).now i want poutine.<eos>nom nom nom is the closest thing to montreal poutine. the fries are similar to some quebec chains. they also seem to use berthelet gravy, which is used by a lot of casse croutes in quebec. and berthelet gravy is vegan.<eos>the little french spot at queens cross station food court makes one of my fav poutines in the city. vegan gravy too i think. crispy shoelace fries, nicely seasoned, lots of cheese curds and gravy., and topped with smoked thyme. ahhh now i want poutine t.t<eos>iunno man i still love harvey’s poutine, i’ve tried a lot of different ones in toronto and meh, but harvey’s always back there for my poutine. also  smokes is another fav but not many of them around.<eos>pano pizza. huge portion, looooads of cheese curds, and (your partner will love this) super cheap for what you get!<eos>my wife doesn’t understand either. this will be my third year in a row i’m going to canada to eat poutine. i’ll be doing some work whilst over there too but my heart is set on the poutine. not sure why it’s not available in the uk yet though.<eos>going just for poutine is a complete waste of time, money and energy. maybe op is rich and doesn’t care.<eos>summilicious up in scarborough is from montreal …. /end thread<eos>i mean, go the other way. rent a bus and sell seats. id sign up and bring some friends. if you can turn what you love into a career, is there anything better?<eos>i love the poutine at grill gate in north york.<eos>rudy has some nice poutines. i recommend yall try it!<eos>i understand the feeling. ive been going to to/ottawa every 2-3 months for the past 2 years (almost 3) to eat popeyes, taco bell, mary brown, etc dont go for that reason only, but its one of the top 3. all my fun money goes towards that and im fine with it.<eos>clearly you just need to add more stuff to the trip to make it better. like swing by ottawa and grab shawarma.<eos>mkkkay op i’m in montreal rn and need your top 3 poutine reccos asapwill also take bagel reccos tysm<eos>ottawa has excellent poutine in case you want to shorten your trip. fritomania is 👌🏻also, a fun date activity would be to make your own curds. ive used this kit in the past and its great. next-day curds were even squeakier: https://cheesemaker.ca/products/poutine-cheese-making-kit<eos>this is currently the best thread on reddit. now if only someone would start a thread on how a&w needs to bring back coney fries….<eos>i am currently sitting at woodbine race track for the chicken breast 2 piece combo my bf grew up eating. its a drive i have to do once a month from barrie. i am familiar with this disorder<eos>this might be a bit out there, but st jacob’s has express ridge dairy which makes fresh cheese curds every friday. they’re north of waterloo if you’re willing to make the (not as long as quebec) drive<eos>wow, i thought i overdo it by driving to peterborough from toronto for poutine but you beat me, lol the whistle stop cafe is the place i go tohttps://www.tripadvisor.ca/restaurant_review-g155008-d4506224-reviews-the_whistle_stop_cafe-peterborough_ontario.html<eos>cant beat \"going to montreal tomorrow for poutine ...\" lol nice.you should also consider starting le club routine poutine that passes your taste test.  theres effort to get it right and to share costs for making a small batch.fresh ingredients is a must and super important it must be served hot & fresh.  share recipes and debate the best combinations.* fresh squeaky curds no more than 8 hours old* lightly peppered chicken & beef stock gravy made the night before* baked fries or double-fried soaked and refrigerated 2-hours in cold water that daypoutine isnt expensive, many would be glad to chip in advance to help pay for the ingredients and free poutine to anyone who likes to cook.  a small monthly club is easier to organize and can be any venue, indoor or outdoor picnic with a reheating pot under a canopy and byo lawn chairs.well maybe only in my dreams.<eos>dump him, hes not poutine positive! you can get a better fry man! (joking...kinda)<eos>travelling that far regularly just for a food seems a bit on the extreme side.  i dont fault your partner one bit.<eos>pfft once every two months taking a road trip is “too much” this is a dud you are dating.<eos>i spend my vacations playing super nintendo games. we should all be able to do our things in vacation without judgement.<eos>harveys makes the best fast food poutine, hands down  popeyes (put the hot sauce on it and some popcorn chicken)<eos>this is crazy ngl but i respect the hell out of it<eos>what’s her name?<eos>bro it cannot be that good 💀<eos>bruh nomnomnom. its better than quite a few mtl places<eos>potato bar, there is one in scarborough and one in the west as well. you can build your own poutine to order!<eos>sumiliscious in scarborough is pretty good, had a few years back just havent gone back because of being to lazy to head up to steele and mccowan area<eos>nomnomnom poutine in kensington is the closest i’ve had to montreal poutine in toronto<eos>nom noms!<eos>is there anything that your partner can do or explore with you in quebec every two months to make it a more enjoyable trip for them? you could always just get a new partner /s (or is it)<eos>just tell him the poutine is just an excuse to spend time with him on romantic road trips. also, always put him ahead of poutine in the stuffing order<eos>i would think vegetarian would make a huge difference. most of the places that sell poutine in bc dont have vegetarian gravy options. the restaurants that only sell poutine probably do, but we dont have a lot of those. clearly, dont come here for poutine, haha.<eos>going to montreal and quebec city, what place to go eat the best poutine?<eos>nomnomnom poutine<eos>the boathouse seafood restaurant in belleville has good poutine.<eos>the blue food truck in front of city hall has poutine that is just as good as any from quebec.<eos>he is basically upset what makes you happy.  poutine is life.i dont think gta has a good poutine place.<eos>try the poutine subreddit<eos>my favourite thing on top of fries is actually the sweet potato kimchi fries from bahn mi boys at queen and spadina. better than any poutine i’ve ever had!<eos>nomnomnom is probably the closest ive found in the gta.<eos>as a former quebecer i love the one from guerrilla burger on bloor w or the poutine dream from hogtown on college 😍<eos>poutine hut  at parliament and queen east amazing.<eos>i honestly find this poutine obsession adorable.<eos>learn how to make it properly and youll never be without.<eos>olde yorke<eos>rudy offers great poutine!<eos>you could try tinder or hinge but toronto meets might be less stressful<eos>would love to know where you’re going for poutine in montreal!<eos>i ate a good one in a bar at distilery district.<eos>honestly, i really like the meltwich poutine!<eos>i am the same but with shawarma. looking for a more local shawarma spot but nothing hits the same as the shawarma in peterborough (omg - oasis mediterranean grill). la banquis is montreal is amazing for poutine<eos>people like the poutine at rudy and the gravy sauce is vegetarian-beet based.<eos>im from quebec & i honestly find the costco poutine to be the best one ive tried so far in toronto. they put sooo much cheese & their crispy & crunchy fries are soo good!<eos>nothing  compares to the og consider yourself lucky it’s only a 5 hour drive<eos>check out la la d’s in oshawa or the french fry guy in burlington, both excellent poutines<eos>break up with this guy!<eos>rudys has poutine! theyre famous for burgers but i always get the poutine. a friend born and raised in quebec swears by it.<eos>i have never felt more seen.  i don’t drive to quebec for poutine but will regularly drive 45 mins - 2+ hours just for food from my favourite places.  happy there’s more people like me haha<eos>what are the places you hit up? i might start doing that too<eos>no offence, but it’s the most overrated food item, with virtually no nutritional value.<eos>clear your partner find you have too much money and too much time to waste<eos>lmao you need to get a new partner.<eos>beyond nom nom have you tried anywhere else? i asked about cheese curds to make my own last week and it was recommended again. i need to go by some, but also try great poutine.<eos>some poutines that are okay and fill the void of not being in montreal. harveys - but gotta eat it right there at the restaurant and make sure they dont close the container. double bacon cheese + jalapeno.costco poutine with extra cheese. once you get your box, open it right away and, go sit, add your cheese and enjoy.<eos>sea witch on st clair!its fish and ships but they cook the fries in beef tallow which is just next level.<eos>this might be the funniest thing i’ve ever seen. and i’m 36.<eos>go to a chip truck<eos>for poutine? nah.  schwartzs yea!<eos>henry’s fish and chips in mississauga<eos>this is not real<eos>any suggestions for a good place in montreal?<eos>you could always go to bc... there is a husband/wife from quebec that opened up a roadside poutine cafe and its so good. near 70 mile house if youre ever in the area. i love to stop by when im driving by on camping trips with my family.<eos>this is both the most wholesome and weirdest  thing i have read and 😍<eos>what are your top spots for vegetarian poutine in quebec?<eos>11pm, wondering if i should go to hull with strangers for poutine tomorrow.<eos>make your own, its not hard<eos>your partner should have known what he was getting himself into.  😂😂😂<eos>the grenadier cafe at high park had an amazing poutine - not sure if they still have it on the menu but i was obsessed and still dream about it from time to time. the fries were kinda seasoned almost? and were soooo crispy. the cheese melted perfectly and the gravy wasn’t too salty. just perfect. costco also has a pretty good poutine believe it or not, but the portion is pretty big just to warn you. also if you do go back to montreal, try the poutine at patati patata friterie. i had it almost a decade ago and it was aaaamaazing!<eos>bring him along. i wouldnt even hesitate to go for some poutine... been out of canada for years...<eos>i dont blame you.. poutine is so good & you cant beat the quality offered in quebec. have fun 🔥<eos>🤣🤣🤣🤣shes getting that french potatoe wedge in francais!find yourself a food in quebec as well & visit solo, youll be glad you had 👌🏿<eos>lollllllllllllllllllll<eos>i know some will disagree, but smokes is good.<eos>i dont know what side of toronto you are on, but i would recommend driving to the little brown cow and buy their fresh cheese curds, the ones that havent been refrigerated yet, they are the best, so squeaky, so flavorful, so fresh. little brown cow https://g.co/kgs/8hwfbyl<eos>sumilicious (middlefield & steeles). the owner there used to work at shwartz in mtl i believe, so they have great smoked meat sandwiches and (imho) pretty solid poutine as well. give them a try. turn your travel costs into more poutine!<eos>swiss chalet and south st burger have great poutine. i lived in montreal for 5 years. trust me. brown fries, deep gravy, generous curds and its $7. the key is u wanna find places that don’t sell it as a marquee item: that way they aren’t stingy with the curds and its great value.<eos>honest question op as i am vegetarian too. most gravy is non-vegetarian . do you find poutineries in quebec often have vegetarian gravy options?<eos>bring partner along for your poutine trips. maybe if he had some amazing poutine, he would understand your needs<eos>when i visit ottawa, i stop at a st. alfred cheese factory to get cheese curds they are the best with poutine. if you like eating cheese curd, they sell some that are freshly made that morning and not chilled. they are so squeaky when you eat them ;) personally, i only like them fresh.<eos>hey! i’m headed to montreal on monday and wanna visit a bunch of poutine places with my husband who is also vegetarian. it would be amazing if you could drop all your montreal poutine recommendations! thanks in advance!!<eos>have you ever tried the poutine in pincourt, quebec, at a place called le belle province. best poutine ive ever had.<eos>forget about your man.. continue the visits, even if you do lock yourself in your hotel and eat poutine, you deserve it. where do i find a woman who loves poutine this much anyways?<eos>having lived in ottawa a few years what i really miss is a good shawarma poutine. nothing quite hits the mark down here<eos>sounds like you need new bf<eos>unironically, costco.<eos>i used to love plain old fires and gravy. it was good, cheap and hit the spot. now because of this poutine crazy, there are no places that just have a side of fries and gravy. they all add cheese curds, call it poutine and then charge the price of a regular entree at which point i may as well just get a burger combo. thank you quebec for ruining good olde fries and gravy.<eos>ive always wanted to try poutine in quebec, i think you convinced me to do the drive just for poutine<eos>bring me back brie and pate pleeease<eos>dump him sis 😂<eos>as an ex-pat poutine connoisseur… philthy philly’s and smokes are the closest you will get. if you venture outside of town, i can recommend a number of chip trucks in cottage country that are will leave you more than satisfied and you will think you made it to montreal… dm me for those. i dont want them to get overwhelmed!<eos>you need only drive to ottawa for the elgin street diner.  thats my wifes go-to poutine place.i call her the poutine queen.<eos>i feel like i need to travel from bc to quebec or somewhere on the east coast and try some poutine…🤤🤤<eos>normally i try to discourage people from moving to ottawa because i dont like that its getting bigger, but you might wanna consider moving to ottawa<eos>wtf i don’t blame him you sound like you’d be a menace to deal with<eos>i like the poutine from union chicken.<eos>have you tried making it at home? you can buy st hubert sauce at the grocery store, get fresh curds from a local market and deep fry your own potatoes. tbh this is the best option imo.<eos>throw the partner away and poutine away.<eos>“poutine” sureeeeeeeeeee. we’re about to find about op has a secret family with 2 kids, a dog, goldfish<eos>goals<eos>you need a new partner<eos>i love that you do this. ottawa also has good poutine<eos>i am going to quebec ( montreal and quebec city) what are your poutine recommendations?<eos>rudy’s is great and is vegetarian.<eos>go with one of your girlfriends and he can stay home next time.<eos>keep going to quebec. life is short.<eos>poutine is not that good.<eos>time to find a new partner, partner<eos>never heard of veg poutine the sauce has chicken in it. i am sure.<eos>how about smokes poutinerie? you have them in ontario. ive tried them in london sometimes around 2011-2012 and they were really good.<eos>smokes poutine. https://smokespoutinerie.com/<eos>it’s very interesting how every single female hobby turns out to be food or how they call it “trying new places”. going to mt every 2 months is not that bad, my ex was worse. is it due to social media or lack of entertainment, anyway no judging, just very curious social pattern.<eos>[deleted]<eos>💀💀💀💀dont know whats worse, that you made this completely ridiculous connection, or that we all fully understand the context and are adding to it.peak turrono 😂<eos>op clearly does not have enough to eat at home with a partner like this :(<eos>you can never have enough poutine at home!<eos>girl has been open and honest about all this poutine, it’s all a man can really ask for.<eos>theres a place my sister took me years ago in hull. they only speak french, theyre super rude - best poutine ive ever had. im so sorry, but i cant remember the name.<eos>alfas is good<eos>a poutine with the good variety of cheese which cannot be sell in most stores in ontario because it’s an unrefrigerated cheese.<eos>funny typo<eos>you can get st-viateur and st-urbain bagels delivered by the truck-load and you can pre-slice and freeze them for longevity!good poutine has remained elusive but this post has some promising ones.<eos>what kind of routine do you have when youre in quebec specifically?<eos>we all need a proutine like that<eos>poutine routine?<eos>thank you<eos>and if you look closely you can find them made the day of or the previous day. can’t beat that for 7.99<eos>but what about the gravy? any tips? the gravy is what does it for me.<eos>they are not fresh though, or i haven’t found any fresh ones yet. so you lose the squeaky experience<eos>yes! it really made me smile. life is so short.  i see nothing wrong here. no harm done. and quebec is so lovely. enjoy your poutine, sis 🥰<eos>i like it even more how it starts with op asking for poutine recs in toronto, then ends with ‘i give up, see you all in montreal tomorrow’ 😭😭 free will girlie<eos>get the poutine, ditch the whiny boyfriend<eos>pick me up on your way by next time.<eos>it was devastating when the location in etobicoke finally closed. a definite family favourite<eos>there’s one in cornwall too.   we were on a trip to the east coast one summer with our young (at the time) kids so we wanted to break up the drive from toronto to saint john so we stopped in cornwall.  my wife was immediately excited - omg we’re gonna eat at st hubert!  even the youngsters were like - uh, isn’t this just swiss chalet?   we chastised them accordingly for their lack of culture.   they know better now.<eos>i want to do that, its their salade de choux huileuse i crave most lol<eos>are you me?<eos>poulet rouge has poutine that is close to real quebec poutine (they”re a quebec chain that expanded to ontario this year). poulet rouge and nomnom are literally the only close ones in all of toronto that i’ve found.<eos>had it 3 times, never been too impressed. i dont get it<eos>everytime this is post. nom nom for the win.<eos>this is such a cliche answer. literally any random poutine place in qc is better. everyone just hive mind agrees anytime nomnom is brought up, but it’s just such a basic answer. pretty much like going to taco bell for mexican and bragging about it.<eos>i think i should. there are not a lot of poutine places here and i would love to make poutine at home with recipes mentioned here and host a once a month poutine club lol<eos>started the poutine community on discord! tell your friends!<eos>leslieville pumps has looked like it is closed for the last month.<eos>this spot also has what i believe to be the best burger in the city, love obq burger, gonna try their poutine next time im there!!!<eos>he always comes with me. we both love driving so its always fun driving to montreal. he just thinks there could be a cheap alternative.<eos>definitely not a troll post. thank you so much..i will definitely visit the area soon<eos>i always thought gravy would be difficult to make..let me check it out, thank you<eos>underrated play on words there. ;-) once you figure out how to make your potatoes and curds, the rest is gravy.<eos>there are way worse things you can be in a relationship than a poutine liker.is it odd to plan frequent trips around this? maybe but idgaf its not my business to judge.<eos>every party has a pooper.<eos>is it a lengthy journey for a snack? yes. would i want you to go every two months? no. but op is an adult and if they wanna road trip to quebec every month and can afford it, why is it absurd?<eos>found ops partner<eos>i was going to say they need a new partner. that would be so fun to just go for that kind of reason.<eos>the reason is novel but visiting montreal every two months doesnt seem unusual. people do things for pleasure that dont have logical reasons -- have hobbies, go to the movies, pay for streaming services, eat at restaurants. unless you do none of these things, its weird that you would take such a strong position on what op says (actually, now that i think it is, even if you did none if these things, it would be weird to single this one out as especially bad).<eos>oh so many options very touristy with average poutine - la banquisebest vegetarian customization - poutinevilleother places i have tried - la fleur, belle province, frite alors, have a long list because we visit different places in quebec everytime but we always go to poutineville at least once<eos>fearless meat on kingston road brings in lester’s!<eos>not op, but the most popular i hear of is la banquise<eos>i started a discord channel, maybe ill start posting there lol i ll even do a poutine party at my place<eos>christ. it’s good but nowhere near the same.<eos>sturgeon falls, ontario is another option. a french canadian town mostly known for their chip trucks and poutine.<eos>the simplicity is exactly what makes it really hard to replicate at home. it really isn’t the same. it’s not because you can make a three ingredient pasta at home that it’s michelin star or “nona” approved.<eos>traditionally, yes. all of them? no.<eos>yessspoutineville belle province lafleurma poule moullie there is a place in laval that has goat-ed shawarma poutine..forgot the name of the place though<eos>ok, i like popeyes poutine too, but i dont think its for everyone. quite different from the standard<eos>not hard with  the quantity of poutine places in mtl, but not better then the good reputable places<eos>we have 25+ people join the discord btw! love this group<eos>i really think the easiest place to find vegetarian gravy is in quebec. in most places the default gravy is vegetarian and everyplace i went had a vegetarian gravy option. ive been to 20+ places.<eos>i know a place in laval which had the best shawarma poutine!<eos>oh so many options very touristy with average poutine - la banquisebest vegetarian customization - poutinevilleother places i have tried - la fleur, belle province, frite alors, have a long list because we visit different places in quebec everytime but we always go to poutineville at least once<eos>vegetarian gravy is super popular.<eos>bruh<eos>smokes fell off hard a few years back.<eos>i dont have instagram or tiktok!<eos>they are the worst. everytime i eat there i leave so disappointed i’m angry. honestly mcdonalds has a better poutine than them (mcdonald’s poutine is actually amazing).<eos>*sad rofo noises*<eos>bro, i read this with rob ford voice 🤣if you know, you know<eos>[deleted]<eos>please ask your sister this is a national emergency<eos>> they only speak french, they’re super rude - best poutine i’ve ever had.lol<eos>the biggest hull trick, acting like they only speak french lol<eos>how rude, can i speak english there or no?<eos>last week i made the reverse typo when applying for a job. i put that i’m an expert at automating and optimizing poutine data processes.shockingly, i got a rejection email today. don’t think the hiring manager shares op’s enthusiasm for poutine.<eos>honestly, poutine routine would make a great band name<eos>st urbain has a stall at the st lawrence market<eos>at the risk of starting a flame war, it’s pretty easy to get montreal-style bagels in toronto these days. kettlemans is good, and has a couple of locations, and that bagel place on bayview (i forget the name but i think there’s also one on eglinton) is good.<eos>i love st viateur bagels<eos>bagel<eos>get alfas from the south shore of montreal<eos>yes<eos>it’s extremely difficult to make homemade poutine as good as the best places in quebec. it can be done but it takes a lot of skill and patience.  i feel you on this. i miss quebec poutine, but my health doesn’t so i guess it balances out.<eos>cannot recommend this enough. toronto has some great cheese shops, gravy mix is usually fine (i like the pork gravy best) and my fav way to serve is with chicken (baked and diced up breast) with peas.<eos>try getting beef tallow fries.<eos>st. hubert instant poutine gravy is good in a pinch if you want some montreal flavour at home, the easy way, haha.<eos>yes!!<eos>agree. new boyfriend.<eos>i go to montreal from new jersey these days. shorter trip too as it’s just straight up interstate 87.<eos>and me<eos>blasphemy…lol. agree that st hubert is a million times better than swiss chalet. we were driving to ns and stopped just before nb and there was a st hubert. made the drive worthwhile :-)<eos>oooh just found one near me; i’ll have to go check it out.<eos>i haven’t tried poulet rouge, and i just learned about them a few days ago. thanks for for the recommendation!<eos>its the closest you can get to montreal poutine here.<eos>i’ll ship you cheese curds from montreal if you want 🤣<eos>oh really? i was there fairly recently but probably over a month ago<eos>how long is the drive? as someone who drives a hybrid, it’s not much of an expense, haha. i guess it depends on the car. also, if he loves driving and you let him, and you love poutine… sounds like a successful road trip. would he rather drive with you to drop $200-$300 on some expensive event each time? poutine is so much cheaper<eos>at least tell me you’re stopping at the wilton cheese factory halfway for proper cheese curds!<eos>check out the discovery harbour area if you do! not sure if they serve poutine lol but it’s a very cute historical area on the water!<eos>dollarama stocks decent poutine gravy. once i decided to surprise an ex montrealer in toronto with home made poutine for her bday. she was celebrating at a bar, i got back from mtl that day and i picked up some cheese curds along the way and made some dollarama gravy and kept it hot in a flask. ordered some fries at the bar and bam, fresh poutine baby<eos>gravy is fundamentally just water and flour mixed to a slop consistency everything else is for flavour of your liking, with using dehydrated \"stock\" aka \"bouillon powder\" being the most economical and easy way to do so.beef or chicken, or chicken and beef are the most common choices, but you can mix and match however you want or use something else entirelythen you throw in some sort of fat (with butter being the most common type) to add smoothness and fullness. lactose intolerant? use lactose free butter! i can guarantee that not a single poutine place is going to be using any sort of high-grade fat for their gravy, so youre already miles ahead of controlling what goes into it by doing it yourselfand then salt and pepper or any other spice as you see fit.boom, you have gravy<eos>thats why they invited you.<eos>do i really have to explain why burning 1+ tanks of gas to eat poison is absurd? adults make absurd choices all the time. that ability to choose to do something doesnt negate absurdity.<eos>[deleted]<eos>[removed]<eos>yesh the reaction here is wild. i have friends who drove (or flew) between toronto and montreal every week, because they had work in one city and family in another. driving over every couple of months is nothing. people getting all preachy about \"think about the gas being burned\" can fuck off, op can do this for the next 50 years and would waste less gas than one far more useless military transport making its daily transatlantic circuit. she will have zero actual impact on the environment compared to the actual pollutors.<eos>thanks! now to convince the family to take a weekend in quebec.<eos>i mean its poutine... in reality how complicated it can be? the maximum effort, the ceiling of requirements for making a perfect poutine is much lower than any other dish. thats my point.<eos>when i went to new york fries. they didnt add gravy to veggie poutine. thats how it got me thinking haha.<eos>ok thank you sooo much! poutineville came up as a recco near my hotel. i’ve never had poutine in quebec so i am so darn excited<eos>ngl it does beat some of those good reputable places.<eos>oh no! i was wondering why the other reactions/downvotes and comments. i went there in october (again 2011-2012ish) and they had a special thanksgiving poutine that was awesome, i even gave their idea to a poutine chain in quebec!<eos>bumbaclot, buddy<eos>the last thing is, op said i want to eat her poutine - ive never said that in my life to her.<eos>lol ok i asked. ill update if i hear back!edit: she texted me back: [https://www.lapatateriehulloise.com/](https://www.lapatateriehulloise.com/)<eos>this has to be the most aggressively canadian /r/askto thread ive seen in quite some time. the urgency for poutine coupled with the politeness, it has it all<eos>yeah it sure seemed like they secretly knew english. i battled my way through in broken french. which they clearly hated.<eos>i live right beside this place and go every few weeks. every single time i hear them respond in english to the many anglophones that come in. its not a thing.<eos>you can certainly try.<eos>i would interview you and only ask poutine related questions<eos>they missed out, clearly!<eos>do a half assed job of it and call it routine poutine<eos>the one on eglinton you may be thinking of is bagel house, there is also one at yonge and st clair that is 24 hour<eos>the real question is where to get good smoked meat in toronto.  my go to is when the pig came home<eos>bagel house is nice to have around but it does now scratch the itch. one of the best parts of living in toronto is easy access to mtl. politics and 💩 roads aside, it’s rad.<eos>you’re absolutely right. bagelhouse gets you most of the way there and the bonus of freshness makes it better than having bagels shipped from montreal. now i just need to find good smoked meat…<eos>they are available frozen at summerhill markets in the annex<eos>i disagree? i feel like making good poutine is pretty straightforward. aside from making gravy from scratch, i dont think much skill is needed (ive always used powered gravy and been happy, but i know some people are snobby about that).<eos>i’ve eaten a lot of takeout poutine and i can say that the deliciousness of the poutine is proportional to how slovenly unkempt the person making it is.<eos>a boyfriend *in quebec*!<eos>heads up it includes 3 toppings of your choice (sounds weird but it mirrors their order process for the main product, chicken bowls). don’t fall for the trap mindset of “i paid for it, why not’. i made that mistake once while flustered and let me tell you, corn does not go on poutine.<eos>be prepared for leftovers. they pack their bowls to the rim with 6 choice of toppings! (havent tried their poutine yet)<eos>omg idk if you are serious or not, but i really want to take you up on this offer.<eos>i haven’t been by this week (staying close to home in heat wave), but someone posted about it looking closed, so i’ve been by to check a few times and it looks like it’s either closed or being renovated.<eos>its like a 6-7 hour drive to montreal, and can be even longer w traffic,  so not close<eos>thank you so much! i love you ❤️ i will try this recipe along with getting cheese curd from u/torontogirl-unite suggestions. will reply with a photo . thanks again<eos>pretty much everything you said is wrong. lmaooopoutine is always brown gravy. and theres a \"secret\" ingredient in most real quececois gravy that keeps it tasting different from anything ontario does<eos>reddit is its little bubble filled with some of the most ridiculous people man. only here will you find people justifying this kind of waste and also have everyone complain about how expensive everything is.<eos>yes you do. going on trips for your mental well being is fine.  and how is poutine poison? especially in quebec where you are eating good quality stuff.<eos>and us stopping the little things that make us happy will fix it?just like me using less gas will fix the minute amount of pollution that isn’t caused by corporations? or the wars being started by little men with too much power?<eos>> they go on a short road trip to get poutine every few months and thats an issue? i dont understand, how insecure in your relationship are you that this is a problem?short road trip? quebec is 8 hours away. why do you assume insecurity? op literally says theyre looking for a cheaper alternative because burning 16 hours of gas, along with hotel expenses and losing all that time in a car is crazy just because you like poutine. especially at a time when were near a recession and the cost of living is sky high. i dont know theyre financial status but if theyre middle class this is crazy. i know were all different, but these \"haha im so quirky\" habits that waste this much time and money are cute at first. but for the long term, i feel like everyone needs a reasonable partner thats willing to make changes to adapt to their lifestyle. props to op for recognizing that. only on reddit will you find people defending this as okay ofc, out in the real world anyone would call you crazy.<eos>it is, this also makes it easier to fuck it up. you can put grated cheese on frozen fries and gravy…. congrats you got yourself a dish that identifies as a poutine<eos>even when they were at their peak, smokes was polarizing (for some reason which i never figured out) and some people loved it (like me) and some people really really didnt.  but they def. fell off and it was before smolkin passed away (rip).<eos>i would never do that, i’m happily married.<eos>some would call you, a man of the people<eos>can confirm. this place is the best in gatineau.<eos>holy shit. i’m in gatineau for the weekend.. 1.1km from this place.<eos>love this 💜<eos>broken english person french is still better than whatever people in hull speak<eos>genuis<eos>yep, that’s the one, and there is also one on bayview south of eg, or at least there used to be when i lived in that neighborhood.<eos>i really like dave’s genuine deli on avenue road north of lawrence. they also have a satellite location downtown in the waterworks food hall on brant st between queen and  adelaide. well worth checking out if you love deli.<eos>centre street deli is pretty good. never heard of when the pig came home but that name is not kosher.<eos>homemade fries can be hit or miss, imo. i have an air fryer, which is nice, but not equivalent to the deep fryers most real poutine places/chip trucks have.<eos>you need to double fry the french fries (once par fried, re-frozen, then fried again), make the homemade gravy, and then package it in a way that forces the heat of all those elements to congeal together into the beautiful artery bloacker we know and love.that is way too much effort for my drunk ass when im craving it.<eos>powder gravy is traditional for poutine. what you miss at home is months-old fryer oil.<eos>i like the way you think<eos>may i use this opportunity to plug their plant based chicken filet bowls. they are so incredibly delicious. i swear their fake grilled chicken is one of the best. and it doesnt cost extra!<eos>hahahaha<eos>what are the best toppings<eos>we have them at costco here :p<eos>it is definitely closed. pretty sure even a blogto article about the closure.<eos>this is the origin story of your future poutine restaurant... 😂<eos>just chiming in to say good luck on your gravy journey and it will be wonderful when you tweak it enough to your taste! i respect your love for poutine lol<eos>if you continue to visit quebec, i recommend a small detour to maple dale cheese just outside of belleville. you can pick up fresh cheese curds there. the fresh curds are so much yummier to snack on than after theyve been sitting in the fridge. used to call it squeaky cheese when i was a kid lol<eos>ooooooooo \"b r o w n\" gravy do you even cook?<eos>as long as it’s not the same people? i’m planning to take a plane full of jet full to another continent for a trip- is that not allowed because it’s wasteful?<eos>[deleted]<eos>slightly more reasonable: gatineau and montreal are ~5 hours. i think they meant the province, not the city. i doubt there’s a poutinerie trucker right on the on-qc border of the 401, but maybe…?<eos>great thread.<eos>go for it! report back!<eos>we need a routine poutine update!!<eos>yeah i mean its really easy to heat up oil in a dutch oven or cast iron pan or even pot on the stove and just make fries. you dont need a separate implement for it and you get restaurant quality fries.<eos>ive just used frozen fries and took some trail and error to find the ones that worked best. ive also used tater tots and honestly really enjoyed it!<eos>its less effort than travelling to quebec lol<eos>if you are drunk, theres no need to go all chef gordon ramsey. powdered gravy and (the right) frozen fries has always worked fine for me and when ive made it for friends/family – no complaints<eos>yes, and my people literally invented poutine 🤡but go enjoy your white poutine, whatever!<eos>if you have the money then go for it. but if you have a partner that says hey \"maybe we shouldnt do that and find a cheaper way\", then youre probably being unreasonable. also a big difference between a once in a lifetime trip and driving 16 hours round trip to eat poutine.<eos>yeah, well a little realism is going to save my sanity a lot more than anything i can do to save the world. and it sounds like you have no problem with people burning jet fuel to make themselves happy - so why is a little gas to quebec got your dander up?<eos>what does it mean? so lost.<eos>depending on the oil that aint cheap<eos>i agree in that these are decent options, but not equivalent to a proper casse-croute or lafleur or belle province, etc.<eos>or high! high poutine is the best poutine!<eos>once in a life time? this will be my 6th time in europe.<eos>rofo doc on netflix should clear it up for u<eos>it truly is. god i love canada<eos>europe is a big place with lots of notable cities.<eos>yes it is, so it’ll be my 4th time in london. actually my 7th in europe. and i’ve been to 24 notable cities in europe? most of those while backpacking for 5 months, two in europe. so, is it a wasteful trip?<eos>are you going there mainly because you want a particular food item? are you staying a single night and then coming back? are you going 6 times a year? do you have the funds to afford it? does your partner ask you if theres a cheaper way to do what you want to do without flying to europe? and then *is there* a way? your little \"gotcha\" attempt doesnt work unless you put yourself in the exact same situation. flying to london 4 times in your life is a far cry from road tripping 16 hours to quebec and staying a single night just to eat poutine, *6 times a year*. learn what nuance is before you attempt this argument again.<eos>my point is that everyone’s circumstances is different. if op is driving to montreal every month to visit family, no one would care. but because they enjoy something they can get at its best there it’s absurd?everyone has different wants and needs. insulting someone else’s harmless one just because it isn’t yours is what’s stupid. to one person london is a trip of a life time. for me it’s just a place i like that i want to go back to. that’s how op feels about quebec, it’s not absurd. i just wouldn’t do it<eos>comparing visiting family to.. eating poutine? absurd, sorry. you keep misrepresenting the situation and intentionally removing details to make it less so. > to one person london is a trip of a life time. for me it’s just a place i like that i want to go back to. youre comparing going to london because its a place you want to go back to vs going there to eat fish and chips. if you told me you went to london 4 times a year, and stayed a single night just to eat fish and chips, id tell you youre absurd *unless* youre filthy rich where you can just do that sort of thing. but we can tell from ops situation that shes not.\n"

Istanbul on College at Bathurst. NomNomNom poutine on Dundas is delish. Rudy’s. I never tried NomNomNom Poutine but that looks legit also. The best poutine in the city is from the Ideal Catering truck (aka brown and cream truck) on St. George, just south of Harbord. They have the best fries and the best gravy. The chip truck at the Leslie and lakeshore CT. It used to be Poutini’s. Oh man that was the ONE. but now I dunno… there’s a good one at The Pumps in Leslieville near where I work. So I’ll go there OR… my other choice is in that Gerrard square mall. Tropical Joe’s has a jerk chicken poutine that’s absolutely amazing. … you’ll laugh, but a killer price/quality is Costco.I think it’s $5.99 and you get a solid 2lbs. (And yeah, it used to be poutini’s)```json{\n",

So I’ll go there OR… my other choice is in that Gerrard square mall.
